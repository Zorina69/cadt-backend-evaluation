Q1: What challenges did you face when using the native http module that Express.js helped you solve?
During I used native http module it take many line of code to get the module and url from request but
when I use express.js I use only app.get(....) and I can do code shorter and easier to look than before.

Q2: How does Express simplify route handling compared to the native HTTP server?
For Express it simplifies route by using (app.get('/route' .....)) to get route but native HTTP it uses 
if (url === '/route' && method === 'GET') to get .

Q3: What does middleware mean in Express, and how would you replicate similar behavior using the native module?
In Express middleware means like function or method that access to the req, res and next object in the application's request-respone cycle. 
To replicate similar behavior using the native module we would create function that process requests before they reach the main route handler.
