Q1: Why do we listen for data and end events when handling POST?
Because POST data arrives in chunks. we collect it using data and process it once complete with end.

Q2: What would happen if we didn't buffer the body correctly?
we would get incomplete or corrupted data, since only part of the body may be received before processing.

Q3: What is the format of form submissions when using the default browser form POST?
it is typically sent as application/x-www-form-urlencoded, unless specitied otherwise.

Q4: Why do we use fs.appendFile instead of fs.WriteFile?
fs.appendFile adds new data without overwriting existing content
fs.writeFile replaces the file

Q5: How could this be improved or made more secure?
- Sanitize input to prevent code injection.
- Use HTTPS for secure data transfer.
- Limit input size to avoid abuse.
- Use frameworks like Express for built-in security and validation.
