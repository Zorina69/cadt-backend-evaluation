Q1: What error message do you see in the terminal when you access http://localhost:3000? what line of code causes it?
TypeError: res.endd is not a function
it is in line 6.
it errors with word end (endd).

Q2: What is the purpose of res.write() and how is it different from res.end()?
For res.write(), we use it to display the respond to clients when they requst successful.
but for res.end(), it means that it already respond to clients.

Q3: What do you think will happen if res.end() is not called at all?
if it is not called at all, I think the server can not know that it already respond or not.

Q4: Why do we use http.createServer() instead of just calling a function directly?
We use http.createServer() to create a real HTTP server that can listen for and respond to incoming web requests. 
Just calling a function wonâ€™t handle HTTP protocols, connections, or provide request/response objects.

Q5:How can the server be made more resilient to such errors during development?
To make the server more resilient during development:
- Use try-catch to handle errors.
- Catch uncaughtException and unhandledRejection.
- Use tools like nodemon to auto-restart on crash.
- Validate user input.
- Log errors for easier debugging.
