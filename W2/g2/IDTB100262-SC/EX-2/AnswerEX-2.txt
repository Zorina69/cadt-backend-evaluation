Q1: What happens when you visit a URL that doesn't match any of the three defined?
It will respond the 404 Not Found error.

Q2: Why do we check both the req.url and req.method?
we check it to sure about the requested URL path and HTTP method.

Q3: Why MIME type (content-Type) do you set when returning HTML instead of plain text?
I set it to HTML because depend on user interface it is look well than only text and HTML we are easy to design the interface.

Q4: How might this routing logic become harder to manage as routes grow?
As routes grow, this routing logic becomes harder to manage because:
- It gets long and messy, making code harder to read.
- Adding new routes increases the chance of errors or duplicates.
- It's harder to reuse or organize logic across different routes.
- There's no separation of concerns, mixing routing and response logic.

Q5: What benefits might a framework offer to simplify this logic?
A framework like Express.js offers several benefits to simplify routing logic:
- Cleaner syntax for defining routes (e.g., app.get('/about', ...)).
- Built-in middleware for parsing requests and handling errors.
- Better organization with route separation and modular files.
- Easier scaling as your app grows.
